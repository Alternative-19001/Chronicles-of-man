                <h1>The Founding and Kings of Rome</h1>
                <h2>Time-Period: 1200 – 510 BC</h2>
                <p>The founding of Rome is steeped in myth, with evidence of early settlements on the Palatine Hill
                    around 750 BCE. According to tradition, Rome was founded on 21 April 753 BCE, celebrated during the
                    festival of Parilia. Two key legends, Romulus and Remus, and Aeneas, both contribute to Rome's
                    origin story. <br><br>After its founding, Rome was ruled by seven kings, whose reigns shaped the
                    early city until the monarchy was replaced by the Roman Republic in 510 BCE.</p>


                <section class="romulus" id="romulus-remus">
                    <h2>The Founding of Rome – Romulus and Remus</h2>
                    <p>King Numitor of Alba Longa was overthrown by his younger brother, Amulius, who sought to
                        eliminate any potential threats to his usurped throne. In an effort to prevent future claims,
                        Amulius killed Numitor’s sons and forced his daughter, Rhea Silvia, to become a Vestal Virgin, a
                        priestess devoted to the goddess Vesta, who was bound by vows of chastity, punishable by death
                        if broken.
                        <br><br><br>
                        However, the god of war, Mars, became captivated by Rhea Silvia's beauty and, while she slept,
                        he fathered twin sons with her. Angered by this, Amulius ordered Rhea Silvia to be cast into the
                        Tiber River, where she was rescued by the river god, who later married her.
                        <br><br>
                        The newborn twins, Romulus and Remus, were placed in a basket that was set adrift on the river.
                        The basket floated downriver until it became entangled in a fig tree. There, a she-wolf, sacred
                        to Mars, found the babies and suckled them until a shepherd discovered them.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container">

                        <p class="image-description">The Founding of Rome – Romulus and Remus with the she-wolf </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In another version of the story, the shepherd took the twins to his wife, a woman who had
                        recently lost a child and nursed the twins as her own. It’s uncertain which version is the
                        original, as the word *lupa* in Latin means both ‘she-wolf’ and ‘prostitute,’ adding ambiguity
                        to the tale.
                        <br><br>
                        As the twins grew, the shepherds revealed their true heritage. Following their heroic lineage,
                        Romulus and Remus raised a group of men and marched against Alba Longa, where they killed
                        Amulius and restored Numitor to the throne.
                        <br><br>
                        The twins then decided to establish a new city near the place where they had been rescued, at
                        the foot of the fig tree. They argued over which hill to build the city on, with Romulus
                        favoring the Palatine Hill and Remus preferring another hill, possibly the Aventine. To settle
                        the dispute, they turned to the gods for guidance. Remus saw six birds, while Romulus saw
                        twelve, which was interpreted as a sign that Romulus’ choice of the Palatine Hill was correct.
                        <br><br>
                        Romulus began marking the city’s boundary with a plow pulled by a white bull and cow. However,
                        Remus, either mocking the process or out of defiance, jumped over the furrow. This was seen as a
                        bad omen, indicating that the city’s defenses might easily be breached. Romulus, in response,
                        killed Remus—either in the heat of anger or through one of his followers—and continued with the
                        establishment of the city.

                <section class="aeneas" id="aeneas">
                    <h2>The Founding of Rome – Aeneas</h2>
                    <p>While the story of Romulus and Remus is often seen as the more widely recognized tale of Rome’s
                        founding today, the legend of Aeneas was arguably the more popular one during the height of the
                        Roman Empire. Indeed, through the works of the poet Virgil, *The Aeneid* became the national
                        epic of the Roman Empire and is regarded as the most celebrated poem of the Roman era.
                        <br><br>
                        Aeneas was a hero who fought in the Trojan War. The son of the goddess Venus and a mortal man,
                        Aeneas managed to escape the fall of Troy. After enduring a long journey, he eventually arrived
                        in Latium, the region through which the Tiber River flows. Aeneas married the daughter of King
                        Latinus, which caused great offense to King Turnus of Rutuli, who also desired her. As was
                        common in ancient stories, a war broke out between Aeneas and Turnus for the hand of the
                        princess. Aeneas, aided by King Tarchon of the Etruscans, fought valiantly for his bride.
                        <br><br>
                        True to his divine heritage as the son of Venus, Aeneas emerged victorious in the conflict.
                        <br><br>
                        The fall of Troy is typically placed around 1220 BC. To bridge the time between Aeneas and
                        Romulus, the Romans had to create a series of fictional kings to fill in the gaps in their
                        history. This was accomplished smoothly across the generations, beginning with Ascanius,
                        Aeneas’s son, and continuing through to Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus and Remus.

                    <h2>The Founding of Rome – Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Around 1000 BC, the Latins settled in the area surrounding Rome, but these early settlements were
                        far from what we would consider a city. They lived in simple, round huts and raised animals like
                        pigs, goats, and cattle.
                        <br><br>
                        How did such humble beginnings lead to a powerful city? While Rome's rise was not inevitable, it
                        had several advantages from the start. Its proximity to the sea opened up opportunities for
                        trade, and its central location on the Italian peninsula placed it at the heart of the
                        Mediterranean. Italy was protected by the Alps to the north and surrounded by the sea.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, the influence of the Greeks, who were settling in southern Italy, helped shape the
                        future of Rome. Cities like Cumae and Tarentum brought advanced civilization to the region, and
                        the Romans learned vital skills like reading and writing. Much of their religion, too, was
                        borrowed from Greek mythology—Jupiter became Zeus, Mars became Ares, Venus became Aphrodite, and
                        so on.
                    </p>

                    <p>To the north of Rome, the Etruscans, an urban society rich from seaborne trade, settled. The
                        Etruscans were seen by the more rugged Romans as decadent and weak, though they, too, were
                        influenced by Greek culture. Around 650–600 BC, the Etruscans crossed the Tiber and occupied
                        Latium. This led to the merging of settlements on the Palatine Hill with those on nearby hills,
                        possibly to defend against invaders or, after conquest, under Etruscan rule through a structure
                        of city-states. This period marks the emergence of the first known kings of Rome.</p>

                    <p>The story of Rome begins with its legendary founder, Romulus. Born to Mars, the god of war, and
                        the priestess Rhea Silvia, Romulus and his twin brother Remus were destined for greatness—or
                        chaos, depending on whom you ask. After being abandoned and miraculously nursed by a she-wolf,
                        the brothers grew up to challenge their fate.

                    <p>
                        Romulus is best known for his bold vision: founding a city that would one day rule the world.
                        But sibling rivalry struck, and in a tragic twist, Romulus killed Remus, solidifying his place
                        as Rome's first king. Despite the controversy, his reign marked the establishment of Roman
                        traditions, including the Senate and early military institutions. He wasn’t just a warrior king;
                        he was the architect of Rome’s very identity.</p>

                <section class="servius-tullius" id="servius-tullius">
                    <h2>Servius Tullius (578–535 BCE)</h2>
                    <p>The sixth king of Rome, Servius Tullius, was an innovator and a reformer. His rise to power is
                        shrouded in myth—born a slave, he was said to have been marked by divine fire as a child, a sign
                        of his extraordinary destiny.
                        <br><br>
                        Servius restructured Roman society, introducing the census, which divided citizens into classes
                        based on wealth, ensuring fairer taxation and military service. He also expanded Rome’s
                        territory, fortifying the city with the first walls, known as the Servian Walls.

                    <p>
                        But Servius’ story is not without drama. His reign ended in betrayal, as his ambitious
                        son-in-law, Tarquinius Superbus, conspired against him. His legacy, however, endured as a king
                        who gave Rome a foundation of organization and equity.</p>

                    <h2>Tarquinius Superbus (535–509 BCE)</h2>
                    <p>The seventh and final king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, earned his infamous title “Superbus” (The
                        Proud) for a reason. His reign was marked by arrogance, oppression, and a disdain for the Roman
                        Senate. Tarquinius seized power through force, overthrowing Servius Tullius in a violent coup.
                        <br><br>
                        Tarquinius built grand monuments, including the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, reflecting
                        his hunger for power and glory. However, his rule pushed Rome to its limits. His tyrannical ways
                        and the horrific actions of his son, Sextus Tarquinius, led to a rebellion that sparked the
                        overthrow of the monarchy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 509 BCE, Tarquinius Superbus was exiled, and Rome transitioned into a Republic, marking the
                        end of its monarchy. His downfall was a pivotal moment, teaching Romans the dangers of unchecked
                        power.</p>
